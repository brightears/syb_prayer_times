## Live Deployment

- **Web Interface**: https://syb-prayer-times-web.onrender.com
- **Default Admin**: admin@syb-prayer.com / prayer2024

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Backend Scheduler** (`/backend`) - A Node.js service that:
   - Runs every minute to check prayer times
   - Fetches prayer times from Aladhan API
   - Monitors and controls music volume via SYB API
   - Stores schedules and history in PostgreSQL

2. **Web Interface** (`/web`) - A Next.js 14 application that:
   - Provides authentication and user management
   - Allows configuration of prayer schedules
   - Shows real-time prayer status and history
   - Supports both admin and client user roles

3. **Database** - PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM:
   - Stores accounts, users, and schedules
   - Tracks prayer mute history
   - Manages user sessions

## User Roles

### Admin Users
- Can view and manage all accounts
- Create/edit/delete prayer schedules for any account
- Add client users to accounts
- Access to all system features

### Client Users
- Can only access their assigned account
- Create/edit/delete prayer schedules for their zones
- Cannot see other accounts or admin features
- Perfect for giving customers self-service access

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Soundtrack Your Brand API token
- Render account (for deployment) or similar hosting

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightears/syb_prayer_times.git
cd syb-prayer-times
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SYB_API_URL` - Soundtrack Your Brand API endpoint
- `SYB_API_TOKEN` - Your SYB API token
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for session tokens
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" for deployment

4. **Set up the database**:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

5. **Seed initial admin user**:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

## Development

Run both backend and web services:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run them separately:
```bash
# Backend scheduler
npm run dev:backend

# Web interface
npm run dev:web
```

## Configuration Guide

### Prayer Time Calculation Methods

- **MWL** - Muslim World League (General purpose, widely accepted)
- **ISNA** - Islamic Society of North America (North America)
- **EGYPT** - Egyptian General Authority of Survey (Africa, Syria, Lebanon)
- **MAKKAH** - Umm al-Qura University, Makkah (Arabian Peninsula)
- **KARACHI** - University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi (Pakistan, India)
- **TEHRAN** - Institute of Geophysics, University of Tehran (Iran)
- **JAFARI** - Shia Ithna-Ashari (Shia regions)

### Smart Prayer Duration

The system automatically calculates prayer durations based on:
- **Prayer Type**: Each prayer has typical durations (Fajr: 12min, Dhuhr: 15min, etc.)
- **Day of Week**: Friday Dhuhr is extended to 30min for Jummah
- **Ramadan**: Isha is extended to 45min to include Tarawih prayers
- **Regional Customs**: Different calculation methods have different typical durations

### Juristic Methods

- **Shafi** (Standard) - Earlier Asr time
- **Hanafi** - Later Asr time (shadow length = 2x object height)

### High Latitude Rules

For locations above 48.5¬∞ latitude:
- **Middle of the Night** - Fajr = mid-point of sunset to sunrise
- **One-Seventh of the Night** - Fajr = 1/7th of the night before sunrise
- **Angle Based** - Use twilight angle from lower latitude
